I’m obsessed with efficiency—not the kind that makes people work harder, but the kind that makes life easier.

I’ve spent my career helping people untangle complex systems, build better ones, and cut through inefficiencies that were quietly draining their time and energy. I’ve done this in tech, education, business operations, and for individuals who just want their daily work to flow more smoothly.

My superpower? I see the big picture and the small fixes. I can watch you work for a day and immediately spot the quick wins—simple shifts that will save you hours every week. I also build long-term systems that fit your brain, your habits, and your actual needs, not just what some app designer thinks you should do.

I stay on top of AI advancements, automation tools, and tech strategies, so you don’t have to. And I’m not interested in complexity for complexity’s sake—I prioritize low-maintenance, high-impact solutions that actually make sense for your work and life.

I bring a judgment-free, practical approach to tech consulting. You don’t need to be an expert to benefit from great systems. You just need a clear, patient, strategic partner who can translate the overwhelming world of tech into solutions that actually help you. That’s where I come in.

If you’re ready to stop wasting time on inefficiencies and start using tools that work for you, let’s talk.
